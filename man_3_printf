- prints and formats output of a given input like the printf() function

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char * format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION

_printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a format and prints it to the standard output

Conversion Specifiers

d, i	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

o, u, x, X, b
	The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned binary (b), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions, and ABCDEF for X conversions.

c	The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

s	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

r	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written in reverse order.

R	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are encrypted using rot13 and then printed

.SH RETURN VALUE

The function returns the number of characters printed if it succeeds.
If it fails, it returns a negative value

.SH EXAMPLE
The following will output a string to the standard output.

_printf("hello");

The following will output a value to the standard output.

_printf("%d", 230001);

The following will output the string in reverse to the output.

_printf("%r", Hello World);
